# The SQLite Detective
Here's a fun way to learn about SQLite and database. Learn or teach the basics of SQL with an interactive game called the SQLite Detective Game (the game's theme is a crime investigation). The game teaches relational database concepts and show how technology can be applied to solving real-life problems. The  SQLite Detective Game is based on the IBM's The IDS Detective Game.

# Game scenario
